# Configuration for my Voron 0.2

I dug parts out of my spare collection and sourced the rest of the parts. Thanks to the PIF community for the printed parts.

## Notable Hardware/Features
- Raspberry Pi 4 B
- SKR Pico as CAN bus bridge
- EBB36 CAN toolhead
- LED lighting (work in progress)

ðŸš§ This is a working repo. Meaning both this configuration works and I'm constantly working on it. ðŸš§

Currently this hold the Klipper config. I hope to add some slicer profiles in the future.

Feel free to reference this as a starting point but it is not reccomended to copy/paste as is.
