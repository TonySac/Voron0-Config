# Configuration for my Voron 0.2

Self sourced Voron 0.2 with Raspberry Pi 4 and BTT Pico brains.

ðŸš§ This is a working repo. Meaning both this configuration works and I'm constantly working on it. ðŸš§

Currently this hold the Klipper config. I hope to add some slicer profiles in the future.

Feel free to reference this as a starting point but it is not reccomended to copy/paste these as is.
